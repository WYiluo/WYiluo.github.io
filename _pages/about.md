Biography
======
I am a final-year PhD candidate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), advised by Prof. Gareth Tyson.
I graduated with first-class honours in my Bachelor's degree from the Australian National University.

Research
======
My research operates at the intersection of computer systems and social computing, with the focus on the Web. The Web is a rapidly evolving, large-scale critical infrastructure. However, this rapid development has led to its emergent properties and systemic risks being poorly understood, posing threats to its stability and to the society that depends on it. The goal of my research is to better understand and thus improve the Web to ensure its safety, fairness, resilience, as well as performance. To achieve this, I employ measurement methods to analyze the critical systems that constitute the modern Web, from both system and societal persoective, identifying challenges and subsequently designing and implementing evidence-based technical solutions. Currently, my work concentrates on the following areas of the modern Web, where significant technological and social changes are fostering new systems and dynamics:

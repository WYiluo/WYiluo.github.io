Biography
======
I am a final-year PhD candidate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), advised by Prof. Gareth Tyson.
I graduated with first-class honours in my Bachelor's degree from the Australian National University.

Research
======
My research focuses on the Web. I use large-scale, data-driven analysis to understand how the Web (including both infrastructures and social dynamics) evolve in response to technological change; and then, address the associated implications of security, safety, fairness, and resilience. Currently, my work concentrates on the following areas of the modern Web:

- Decentralized Web [NSDI '24](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi24-wei.pdf), [CoNEXT '25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05709), [INFOCOM '24](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10621404), [USENIX Security '24](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-sokoto.pdf)
- Livestream [WWW '25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01553), [CSCW '25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00780), [WWW '26](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08972)
- Generative AI's Impact on the Web [MM '24a](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18463), [MM '24b](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12876), [NDSS '26](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01247),  [arXiv '25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20817)
